        <h1>The Faraemon Rulebook</h1>
        <h3>Updated on the 22nd of July, year 2025 - Version 0x.1000</h3><br>
        <p>By using anything related to Faraemon America, you agree to the terms below. This document is here to make sure everything stays fun, fair, and not a total mess. By you (indicated as "you" as in "you, the consumer") following our (indicated as "us," "we," or "our," as in "Faraemon America") Terms of Service, we can ensure safety in our games. We appreciate you reading this.</p>
        <h2>Disclaimer Before You Read</h2>
        <p>You are only liable to follow these terms of service on the Server "API.FARAEMON.COM". This means if you decide to make your own server and host your own players, you are subject to their terms of service rather than ours because of the fact we (1) cannot control nor monitor at all the servers that aren't ours, and (2) do not want to take away from the end user experience. So likewise, yes, <strong>this game complies with the Stop Killing Games, Stop Destroying Videogames, and any other non-for-profit organizations targeted toward stopping developers from ending the lives of countless games. We consent and we allow further use upon the fact that our servers will not last forever, and we are proud to be enforcing these rulings.</strong></p><br>
        <h3>Definitions (11)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>"You", "Player", "User"</strong> - Refers to any individual who interacts with Faraemon America services, including but not limited to gameplay, account creation, and community engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>"We", "Us", "Our", "I", "Faraemon America"</strong> - Refers to the developers, moderators, and official operators of the game/server under the faraemon.com domain and its official applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Token</strong> - A free-to-earn digital currency used within our services to access features like trading, GeoMapping, and moderation tools. You receive at least 64 tokens per day, with a cap of 128 unless modified by server admins or unless you switch servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Faracia (Fair-ay-shuh)</strong> - A premium, purchasable digital currency used for extra content, trades, customization, or other server-based actions. Cannot be exchanged between servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Client</strong> - Any internet-connected mobile device with GPS capabilities used to access Faraemon games.</li>
            <li><strong>PC Client</strong> - Any non-mobile device (like laptops or desktops) without GPS used to access Faraemon games.</li>
            <li><strong>IP Group</strong> -  A small cluster of up to 7 unique IP addresses linked to one user, typically representing your household, close friends, or devices you regularly use. Two accounts maximum can be created per IP Group. Any number of accounts can join such IP Group if they wish.</li>
            <li><strong>Server</strong> - A game-hosting environment. This could be our official api.faraemon.com server or an unofficial one hosted by a third-party player.</li>
            <li><strong>Open Source Server Code</strong> - A free-to-request version of the Faraemon server backend. Can be used to host your own game version with your own rules and economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Termination</strong> - A temporary or permanent ban from accessing Faraemon America servers due to rule violations or abuse, if applied by Faraemon America, or A temporary or permanent ban from accessing community servers due to rule violations or abuse, if applied by the community.</li>
            <li><strong>Bargaining</strong> - An upcoming feature allowing users to negotiate trades or values for items or tokens. Not available at time of writing.</li>
        </ol>        
        <br><h3>Account Opt-Out Rules</h3>
        <p>If you would like to opt out of these rules, you need to be made aware that doing so will ban your IP address, your email, your entire account and will also remove every single little bit of information about you. This is to 100% ensure every last little bit about you that could get you doxxed is removed. The ban will last thirty (30) days, but if you don't associate yourself with Faraemon America other than on their community tabs, meaning you don't play the games and you don't purchase anything of ours directly on <a href="https://shop.faraemon.com">the Official Faraemon Store</a>, then your information stays permanently deleted. This makes it inherently impossible to dox you directly from accessing random server files (which may or may not include our archives).</p><br>    
        <h3>Account Basics in General</h3>
        <p>You must be 13 years or older (or the legal age in your country) to use our services. If your account gets terminated because of bad behavior (ergo you decide to try to implode the servers we have or you threaten other users), that's entirely on you. You may have up to 2 accounts on an IP Group address, and an IP Group address consists of up to 7 IP addresses that any of your devices can play on. Likewise, other people around you (e.g. neighbors or friends from school) can join your IP group which connects them to both your Mobile Client and your PC Clients.</p><br>
        <h3>What is a Mobile/PC Client?</h3>
        <p>A Mobile Client is any cellular device with an active GPS that is able to play our games. A PC Client is any non-cellular device that doesn't have a GPS but still has an internet connection, so they're able to play the game just not walking around (think of it like storage for your Faraemon).</p>
        <h3>Community Rules</h3>
        <p>Mainly, these are the rules we have set for people:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>No harassing, griefing, spamming, or doing anything that intentionally ruins the experience for others.</li>
          <li>If you're warned or banned, do not spam the server with pings or complaints—it'll only make things worse.</li>
          <li>Stay safe, respectful, and responsible. Everything you do <strong>comes back around to you.</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>We see activity logs. Being honest with us usually works out better than lying your way out of things.</p>
        <br><h3>Usage and Fair Play</h3>
        <p>You get at least 64 tokens automatically in a 24 hour period. you can have up to 128 at a time (excluding ones received from purchasing Token Packages). These tokens are used for communicating to the servers we have about information from GeoMapping to simply checking out your ban records. 2 tokens can be used to trade in for 1 Faracia (Packages to get Faracia are 50, 200, 500, 900, 1400 and 2000) and it costs about $0.50 USD, $0.70 CAD or $0.75 AUD for a package of 100 Faracia.</p>
        <p>What you use your quota on is your business—but please don't spam weird backend commands. In-game commands are fine -- they're more than fine -- but outside of that alone, most commands we don't like and our server doesn't like either.</p>
        <br><h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
        <p>You cannot try to break the system; if you want to get source code all you have to do is just ask. You yourself cannot try to reverse engineer our server or the backend. We will give you the open-source server code upon request. You also cannot sell your tokens to other users (albeit the only exception to this is from Bargaining, although that is a new feature coming soon), and you cannot sell your account for monetary value. I'm not sure why you would want to store 7 IP addresses in an IP group, then sell that information to someone else. Kinda defeats the purpose of anti-doxxing......</p>
        <br><h3>What can other people do?</h3>
        <p>Odds are that you have a few friends with computers that need some sort of, well, purpose. This implies they want to start up their own servers. Here's what you can do if you want to start your own server:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>You can paywall your server.</strong> Yup, that's legal. You can charge people to play. Just don't be greedy—10 Faracia is a decent start.</li>
          <li><strong>You can ban, mod, and kick people however you like.</strong> No need to wait for 600 approval requests. Your server, your rules.</li>
          <li><strong>You can tweak the economy.</strong> Token caps, Faracia exchange rates, etc. Want people to earn 256 tokens daily and buy 200 Faracia for 60 cents? Go for it. But remember—currencies don't transfer between servers.</li>
          <li><strong>You can host merch.</strong> We sell shirts. You can sell whatever you want—as long as it's legal in your region. Backpack? Sure. $4M body pillow? Do it. Just... we'll silently judge you if we ever meet IRL.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><h3>Termination Clause</h3>
        <p>You could lose access to our servers themselves if you break our terms. If you get banned from our servers, you are more than welcome to continue the journey elsewhere (ergo on a different server). If you need suggestions, please feel free to contact the developer on Discord.</p>
        <p>We are not liable for any losses if the game crashes, bans occur, save files get corrupted, or if someone else uses your account without permission. You are entitled to use the service as-is, with no liability on our end.</p>
        <p>Likewise, and I cannot stress this enough, but once you're on someone elses' server, <strong>you need to follow their rules.</strong> You're on your server? Great. You can do whatever you want. You follow our rules on our servers, others' rules on their servers, and your rules on your server. Should be simple enough.</p>
        <p>Any potential liabilities that come from us are vulnerabilities such as the developer intentionally doxxing, the developer or company supporting doxxing, and other sorts of activities. Likewise, this game was developed and hosted within the United States, and complies with relevant US law. Any exceptions to liability are based on that jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to update the ToS for any reason, for any benefit to us or to you as the consumer. We may post them on social medias such as Discord, or on our Website or in-app.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>That's all. Now go have fun.</p>
